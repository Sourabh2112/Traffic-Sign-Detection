# üö¶ Real-Time Traffic Sign Recognition with CNN

This project demonstrates a deep learning-based system to detect and recognize German traffic signs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. It supports both training and real-time detection using a webcam feed.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Dataset**: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)
- **Model**: Custom CNN architecture built with Keras
- **Preprocessing**: Grayscale, Histogram Equalization, Normalization
- **Augmentation**: Rotation, Zoom, Shift, Shear
- **Real-Time Detection**: Capture live video, classify signs, and highlight predictions
